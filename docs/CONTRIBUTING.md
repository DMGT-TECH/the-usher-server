## Contribution process

Contibuting to The Usher starts by filing a Github issue.  Categories of issues include: bug, documentation, enhancement. If it's an enhancement, the issue should provide an Overview as to the importance of the new feature, list any Requirements, and any Open Questions related to the issue or design.  If it's a bug request, the issue should provide an Overview, and steps to replicate the bug.

The Usher committers actively triage and respond to GitHub issues. In general, we recommend waiting for feebdack from a The Usher committer or community member before proceeding to implement a feature or patch. This is particularly important for significant changes, and will typically be labeled during triage with needs design.

After you have agreed upon an implementation strategy for your feature or patch with a The Usher committer, the next step is to introduce your changes (see developing changes) as a pull request against the The Usher's Server Repository (`the-usher-server`). The Usher committers actively review pull requests and are also happy to provide implementation guidance.

Once your pull request against the The Usher Repository has been merged, your corresponding changes will be automatically included in the next The Usher release. Every change is listed in the The Usher release notes and Changelog.

Congratulations, you have just contributed to The Usher. We appreciate your contribution!
